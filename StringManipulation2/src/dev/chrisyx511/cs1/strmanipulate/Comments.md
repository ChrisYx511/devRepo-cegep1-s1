# Comments and best practices
1. Explain a class, linebreaks between code and comment
2. Camelcase for methods
3. Capital letter for class name
4. Spaces around equal signs
```java

//LINEBREAK

public class Calculator {
    // Declaration of num1 and 2 variables
    int num1 = 3;
    int num2 = 5;
    
    //Method to obtain sum from num1 and num2
    public int calc() {
        return num1 + num2
    }
}
```
